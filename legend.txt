1. (1,1) across: If replicated by future experiments, that simple chirp, which rose to the note of middle C before abruptly stopping, seems destined to take its place among the great sound bites of science, ranking with _ Graham Bells Mr.
2. (6,1) down: The chirp is also sweet vindication for the _ Science Foundation , which spent about $1.1 billion over more than 40 years to build a new hotline to nature, facing down criticism that sources of gravitational waves were not plentiful or loud enough to justify the cost.
3. (4,3) across: Another group of astronomers who go by the name Bicep made headlines in 2014 when they claimed to have _ gravitational waves from the beginning of the Big Bang, using a telescope at the South Pole.
4. (1,7) across: The researchers calculated that a _ gravitational wave from out in space would change the distance between a pair of mirrors by an almost imperceptible amount: one part in a billion trillion.
5. (3,7) down: More generally, it means that a century of innovation, testing, questioning and _ hard work after Einstein imagined it on paper, scientists have finally tapped into the deepest register of physical reality, where the weirdest and wildest implications of Einsteins universe become manifest.
6. (1,9) across: A team of scientists announced on Thursday that they had heard and recorded the sound of two _ holes colliding a billion light-years away, a fleeting chirp that fulfilled the last prediction of Einsteins general theory of relativity .
6. (1,9) across: I was freaking out, said Janna Levin, a theorist at Barnard College at Columbia who was not part of LIGO but was granted an early look at the results for her warts-and-all book about the project, _ Hole Blues, to be published this spring.
6. (1,9) across: Detailed analysis of its form told a tale of Brobdingnagian activities in a far corner of the universe: the last waltz of a pair of _ holes shockingly larger than astrophysicists had been expecting.
7. (2,11) across: Conveyed by these gravitational waves, power 50 times greater than the output of all the stars in the _ combined vibrated a pair of L-shaped antennas in Washington State and Louisiana known as LIGO on Sept. 14.
