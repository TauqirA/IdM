1. (1,1) down: _ large black holes may exist at the center of some galaxiesincluding our own Milky Way.
2. (3,3) across: Astronomers think the object shown in this _ X-ray Observatory image (in box) may be an elusive intermediate-mass black hole.
3. (1,6) across: Few such _ black holes have been discovered, and scientists aren't sure how they form.
4. (7,1) down: With no force to check gravity, a _ black hole shrinks to zero volumeat which point it is infinitely dense.
4. (7,1) across: Many black holes exist in _ star systems .
5. (4,6) down: Because they are so small, distant, and dark, black holes cannot be _ observed.
6. (1,12) across: In younger stars, _ fusion creates energy and a constant outward pressure that exists in balance with the inward pull of gravity caused by the star's own mass.
7. (6,10) down: They are similar to _ black holes but grow to enormous size because there is so much matter in the center of the galaxy for them to add.
8. (1,15) across: Black holes can _ limitless amounts of matter; they simply become even denser as their mass increases.
9. (6,14) across: Such an explosion scatters most of a star into the void of space but leaves behind a large "cold" remnant on which fusion no _ takes place.
10. (10,10) down: But in the dead remnants of a massive supernova, no _ opposes gravityso the star begins to collapse in upon itself.
11. (9,11) across: Black holes are the cold remnants of former stars, so dense that no matternot even lightis able to escape their _ gravitational pull.
12. (4,18) across: Located about 32 million light-years from Earth in the Messier 74 galaxy (M74), this _ emits periodic bursts of x-rays at a rate that suggests it is much larger than a stellar-mass black hole but significantly smaller than the supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies.
13. (9,14) down: When _ stars reach the final stages of their lives they often detonate in cataclysms known as supernovae .
14. (11,14) down: These "tunnels" could allow _ travel through space and timebut there is no evidence that they exist.
15. (16,10) down: Planets, light, and other matter must pass close to a _ hole in order to be pulled into its grasp.
15. (16,10) down: _ holes capture the public's imagination and feature prominently in extremely theoretical concepts like wormholes .
15. (16,10) down: A _ hole with a mass equal to that of the sun would have a two-mile (three-kilometer) radius.
15. (16,10) down: _ holes pull matter and even energy into themselvesbut no more so than other stars or cosmic objects of similar mass.
16. (11,17) across: Even the light from such a star is unable to escape its _ gravitational pull.
