        <p2 color = "grey">
        1. (1,1) across: These holes may _ pull mass from their neighboring star, growing the black hole and shrinking the other star, until the black hole is large and the companion star has completely vanished.</p2>
        <br>
        <p2 color = "grey">2. (2,1) down: Located about 32 million light-years from Earth in the Messier 74 galaxy (M74), this _ emits periodic bursts of x-rays at a rate that suggests it is much larger than a stellar-mass black hole but significantly smaller than the supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">3. (5,3) across: With no force to check gravity, a _ black hole shrinks to zero volumeat which point it is infinitely dense.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">4. (10,1) down: Yet scientists have confirmed their _ suspicions that they exist.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">5. (4,7) across: _ large black holes may exist at the center of some galaxiesincluding our own Milky Way.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">6. (8,6) down: This is typically done by _ mass in a region of the sky and looking for areas of large, dark mass.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">7. (3,11) across: When they reach a point of no return they are said to have entered the event horizon the point from which any escape is impossible because it _ moving faster than the speed of light.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">8. (2,13) across: Few such _ black holes have been discovered, and scientists aren't sure how they form.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">9. (13,2) down: These "tunnels" could allow _ travel through space and timebut there is no evidence that they exist.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">10. (6,10) down: In younger stars, _ fusion creates energy and a constant outward pressure that exists in balance with the inward pull of gravity caused by the star's own mass.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">11. (16,2) down: Black holes are the cold remnants of former stars, so dense that no matternot even lightis able to escape their _ gravitational pull.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">12. (13,5) across: Even the light from such a star is unable to escape its _ gravitational pull.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">13. (10,9) across: Because they are so small, distant, and dark, black holes cannot be _ observed.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">14. (19,1) down: Such an explosion scatters most of a star into the void of space but leaves behind a large "cold" remnant on which fusion no _ takes place.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">15. (4,16) across: But in the dead remnants of a massive supernova, no _ opposes gravityso the star begins to collapse in upon itself.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">16. (14,9) down: Astronomers think the object shown in this _ X-ray Observatory image (in box) may be an elusive intermediate-mass black hole.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">17. (12,11) across: A _ hole with a mass equal to that of the sun would have a two-mile (three-kilometer) radius.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">17. (12,11) across: _ holes pull matter and even energy into themselvesbut no more so than other stars or cosmic objects of similar mass.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">17. (12,11) across: _ holes are small in size.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">17. (12,11) across: _ holes capture the public's imagination and feature prominently in extremely theoretical concepts like wormholes .</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">17. (12,11) across: Planets, light, and other matter must pass close to a _ hole in order to be pulled into its grasp.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">17. (12,11) across: The star's own light becomes trapped in orbit, and the dark star becomes known as a _ hole.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">17. (12,11) across: That means that a _ hole with the mass of our own sun would not "suck" objects into it any more than our own sun does with its own gravitational pull.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">18. (12,15) across: They are similar to _ black holes but grow to enormous size because there is so much matter in the center of the galaxy for them to add.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">18. (12,15) down: While most _ end up as white dwarfs or neutron _ , black holes are the last evolutionary stage in the lifetimes of enormous _ that had been at least 10 or 15 times as massive as our own sun.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">19. (10,17) across: When _ stars reach the final stages of their lives they often detonate in cataclysms known as supernovae .</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">20. (16,13) down: A _-solar-mass hole, like that believed to be at the center of some galaxies, would have a radius of just about two _ miles (three _ kilometers)only about four times the size of the sun.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">21. (18,12) down: Black holes can _ limitless amounts of matter; they simply become even denser as their mass increases.</p2><br>
        <p2 color = "grey">22. (14,19) across: Many black holes exist in _ star systems .</p2><br>
