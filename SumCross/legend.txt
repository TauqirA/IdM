1. (1,1) across: These holes may _ pull mass from their neighboring star, growing the black hole and shrinking the other star, until the black hole is large and the companion star has completely vanished.
2. (2,1) down: Located about 32 million light-years from Earth in the Messier 74 galaxy (M74), this _ emits periodic bursts of x-rays at a rate that suggests it is much larger than a stellar-mass black hole but significantly smaller than the supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies.
3. (5,3) across: With no force to check gravity, a _ black hole shrinks to zero volumeat which point it is infinitely dense.
4. (10,1) down: Yet scientists have confirmed their _ suspicions that they exist.
5. (4,7) across: _ large black holes may exist at the center of some galaxiesincluding our own Milky Way.
6. (8,6) down: This is typically done by _ mass in a region of the sky and looking for areas of large, dark mass.
7. (3,11) across: When they reach a point of no return they are said to have entered the event horizon the point from which any escape is impossible because it _ moving faster than the speed of light.
8. (2,13) across: Few such _ black holes have been discovered, and scientists aren't sure how they form.
9. (13,2) down: These "tunnels" could allow _ travel through space and timebut there is no evidence that they exist.
10. (6,10) down: In younger stars, _ fusion creates energy and a constant outward pressure that exists in balance with the inward pull of gravity caused by the star's own mass.
11. (16,2) down: Black holes are the cold remnants of former stars, so dense that no matternot even lightis able to escape their _ gravitational pull.
12. (13,5) across: Even the light from such a star is unable to escape its _ gravitational pull.
13. (10,9) across: Because they are so small, distant, and dark, black holes cannot be _ observed.
14. (19,1) down: Such an explosion scatters most of a star into the void of space but leaves behind a large "cold" remnant on which fusion no _ takes place.
15. (4,16) across: But in the dead remnants of a massive supernova, no _ opposes gravityso the star begins to collapse in upon itself.
16. (14,9) down: Astronomers think the object shown in this _ X-ray Observatory image (in box) may be an elusive intermediate-mass black hole.
17. (12,11) across: A _ hole with a mass equal to that of the sun would have a two-mile (three-kilometer) radius.
17. (12,11) across: _ holes pull matter and even energy into themselvesbut no more so than other stars or cosmic objects of similar mass.
17. (12,11) across: _ holes are small in size.
17. (12,11) across: _ holes capture the public's imagination and feature prominently in extremely theoretical concepts like wormholes .
17. (12,11) across: Planets, light, and other matter must pass close to a _ hole in order to be pulled into its grasp.
17. (12,11) across: The star's own light becomes trapped in orbit, and the dark star becomes known as a _ hole.
17. (12,11) across: That means that a _ hole with the mass of our own sun would not "suck" objects into it any more than our own sun does with its own gravitational pull.
18. (12,15) across: They are similar to _ black holes but grow to enormous size because there is so much matter in the center of the galaxy for them to add.
18. (12,15) down: While most _ end up as white dwarfs or neutron _ , black holes are the last evolutionary stage in the lifetimes of enormous _ that had been at least 10 or 15 times as massive as our own sun.
19. (10,17) across: When _ stars reach the final stages of their lives they often detonate in cataclysms known as supernovae .
20. (16,13) down: A _-solar-mass hole, like that believed to be at the center of some galaxies, would have a radius of just about two _ miles (three _ kilometers)only about four times the size of the sun.
21. (18,12) down: Black holes can _ limitless amounts of matter; they simply become even denser as their mass increases.
22. (14,19) across: Many black holes exist in _ star systems .
